# 11503 Hyperfang
**11503 Hyperfang** is a high-school robotics team that competes under the *FIRST* Tech Challenge. This repository contains our code for the 2018-2019 season, Rover Ruckus.

This year, the software team is composed of 3 members: *Software Lead (and APM) Caleb Browne*, *Daniel Kasabov*, and *Shaan Kumar*.

For more information about **11503 Hyperfang**, visit our website. *(Coming Soon)*

## Concepts & Features
**11503 Hyperfang** uses multiple concepts and features in our code to create a successful application for the robot. Some of the features of our project include:

* **Redacted** - Redacted until 2/9/2019.

* **PID Controller** - Precise control of our robot movement is important, so we achieve this by adding a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to our movement methods.

* **Computer Vision** - In order to sense objects, we utilize an Open Source Computer Vision Library called OpenCV. Using OpenCV allows us to interact with the game field in numerous ways.

* **Redacted** - Redacted until 2/9/2019.

### Javadoc Reference Material
